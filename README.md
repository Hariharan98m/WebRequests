# WebRequests

An app to make a GET request to https://android-club-project.herokuapp.com/upload_details?reg_no=xxxx&mac=yyyyy passing our own paramaters for reg_no and device mac. It has a simple UI. Once you open, it shows Device MAC, then prompts you for Reg. no. Type in the last 4 digits and it makes the req to https://android-club-project.herokuapp.com/ and renders the response in a TextView.
